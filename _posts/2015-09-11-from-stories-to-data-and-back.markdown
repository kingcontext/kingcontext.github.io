Maybe, _stories are just data with a soul_. That's a statement of Dr. [BrenÃ© Brown](http://brenebrown.com/) about her being a researcher, a storyteller, or both.

Today's (big) (smart) data analytics is all about analyzing raw data, recorded from stories and stripped of soul. The recording _context_ is the most soul that's left.

The insights gained from analytics generates new data. But how do we add the right soul to that new data, to make it actionable, **to tell the right stories?** I think we need to record more context _soul_ in the first place.
